        "\n",
        "Select the top 200 liquid cryptocurrencies (by market cap or trading volume) listed on major exchanges (e.g. Binance, Bybit). Focus on widely-traded USDT pairs or spot markets to ensure data availability. Gather **daily** OHLC (open, high, low, close) prices and volume for each coin over the past 2 years. For example, use Bybit’s USDT perpetual symbols (category “linear”) and Binance spot tickers. Limit to coins with continuous trading history (discard very new or illiquid assets). Align all data on a common calendar (crypto trades 24/7, but we use daily UTC bars). Ensure consistent symbol naming across sources (e.g. BTCUSDT on both).\n",
        "\n",
        "To illustrate, one can fetch all Bybit tickers via Pybit and load them into pandas. The screenshot below shows a DataFrame of tickers and their latest prices/volumes (column names: symbol, lastPrice, indexPrice, markPrice, 24h change, volume, etc.). In practice, you’d loop over these symbols to download their historical daily data. Use both Binance and Bybit APIs to diversify sources – for example, the Binance API’s `get_historical_klines` (Python-Binance) and Bybit’s `get_kline` endpoints.\n",

        "## 2. Data Collection\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Paginate Through History:** Exchanges often limit each call (e.g. 200 bars). To get 2 years of data, loop by setting start/end timestamps or “from” dates. For instance, repeatedly call `get_kline` with a moving start date:\n",

        "## 3. Data Cleaning & Normalization\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Handle Missing or Duplicate Data:** Crypto trades continuously, but if any daily bar is missing (rare), you can forward-fill or interpolate. Remove any exact duplicate timestamps after concatenation (e.g. `df.drop_duplicates(subset='timestamp', keep='last')`). Ensure each coin’s DataFrame is strictly increasing in time.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Filter Outliers:** Optionally remove spurious spikes caused by data errors (e.g. a 90% jump one day then revert). You could cap daily returns or apply simple filters.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Normalization:** Scale features so they are comparable across coins and suitable for ML. Common approaches are:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Price-based features:** Convert raw prices to percentage changes or log-returns to normalize scale. This also stabilizes variance.\n",
        "  * **Technical indicators:** Many (like RSI 0–100) are already bounded. For raw indicators or other features, apply scaling (MinMax or z-score). For example, one approach normalized data with `MinMaxScaler` and `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn. This ensures features like moving averages (which track price level) don’t dwarf oscillators.\n",
        "  * **Cross-Asset Features:** If you compute e.g. ratios or differences between assets, those may need scaling too (though relative features are often already normalized by construction).\n",
        "\n",
        "Normalization reduces bias in ML training. Just as \\[16] applied MinMax and Standard scaling to features in a crypto trading pipeline, follow similar practice. At minimum, ensure each feature has zero mean/unit variance (or in \\[0,1] range) across the training set.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Feature Engineering\n",
        "\n",
        "Craft features that summarize recent price/volume behavior:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Trend/Moving Averages:** Compute moving averages (MA) and exponential MAs for various windows (e.g. 7, 14, 50 days). These smooth out noise and reveal trend direction; an upward MA slope indicates a bullish trend. Moving averages are “widely used in technical analysis… to keep track of price trends”. You can also use MA crossovers (e.g. 50-day SMA crossing 200-day SMA).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Momentum Indicators:** Calculate momentum/oscillator features. The **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** over 14 days measures price change magnitude and flags overbought/oversold levels. Specifically, “RSI measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes to detect overbought or oversold conditions”. Values above 70 (or below 30) could be useful signals. Compute **MACD** (difference between 12-day EMA and 26-day EMA, with a 9-day EMA signal line). MACD shows shifts in momentum; when the short EMA crosses above the long one (MACD > 0), momentum is up; when it goes below, momentum is down.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Volatility Measures:** Include features like the **Average True Range (ATR)** (e.g. 14-day) or rolling standard deviation of returns. ATR is a classic volatility indicator – a higher ATR means more volatility. Indeed, “a stock experiencing a high level of volatility has a higher ATR”. You can also use other volatility proxies like Bollinger Band width, price range, or variance of returns.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Volume & Sentiment:** Incorporate volume-based features (e.g. OBV – On-Balance Volume, or 3-day average volume relative to normal). A sudden surge in volume can precede big moves. Include any readily-available sentiment or funding-rate features if desired (from Bybit/Binance stats).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Cross-Asset Indicators:** Use information from other assets. For example, compute each coin’s price ratio to Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), or include recent returns of the crypto market index or S\\&P 500 as features. Another approach is to include correlations or principal components across coins. One study built a correlation matrix between Bitcoin, gold, S\\&P500, etc., finding overall positive co-movements. Such cross-asset signals (e.g. “if BTC jumps, many alts also tend to move”) can help the model generalize across market regimes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, feature-engineer dozens of signals: several MA/EMA trends, RSI, MACD values, ATR (or volatility), momentum (price changes), and a few cross-crypto or cross-market variables. Each feature should be a function of the current or recent days’ data at time *t*.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. Labeling Criteria (Entry Points)\n",
        "\n",
        "We want to label each day as a *buy entry* (1) or not (0) based on whether a sufficiently profitable move follows. Define: **label = 1** if the price increases by ≥10% within the next 2–3 days; otherwise 0. Concretely, for each date *t*: compute the 2-day and 3-day forward returns, e.g.\n",
        "$R_2 = \\frac{Close_{t+2}}{Close_t} - 1,\\quad R_3 = \\frac{Close_{t+3}}{Close_t} - 1.$\n",
        "If max(R\\_2, R\\_3) ≥ 0.10 (i.e. ≥10% gain), then mark day *t* as an entry (1). This effectively places an “upper take-profit barrier” at +10% above entry. (In triple-barrier terminology, that would be the profit barrier.) Otherwise label it 0. This is a threshold-based labeling scheme: others have used similar thresholds to intercept significant moves. By setting a fairly large threshold (10%), we focus on clear big moves and improve reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Avoiding overlaps:* If one entry is labeled on day *t*, you might skip labeling on days *t+1* or *t+2* to avoid multiple overlapping signals from the same move (optional). Also ensure that the target day (t+2 or t+3) exists (drop the last 3 days where lookahead is impossible).\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. Handling Class Imbalance\n",
        "\n",
        "Profitable entries (10%+ moves) are relatively **rare**, so the positive class will be much smaller than the negatives. To address imbalance:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Resampling:** Use oversampling methods to boost minority examples. For instance, the SMOTE algorithm creates synthetic minority-class samples by interpolating between existing ones. Analytics Vidhya notes that “SMOTE is specifically designed to tackle imbalanced datasets by generating synthetic samples for the minority class”. Apply SMOTE or ADASYN to the training set so that “entry” days are not heavily outnumbered. Alternatively, randomly undersample non-entry days.\n",
        "* **Class Weights:** If using tree or deep models, set a higher class weight (or cost) for positive signals so the model pays more attention to them.\n",
        "* **Evaluation Metrics:** Use precision, recall, F1 or area under the precision-recall curve (rather than accuracy) to account for imbalance. In backtesting, emphasize metrics like win rate and profit-per-signal.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to prevent the model from always predicting 0. Techniques like SMOTE (oversampling the 1s) have proven successful in ML pipelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 7. Train/Test Split and Validation\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Chronological Split:** Because this is time series data, split by date rather than random shuffling. For example, train on the first \\~70–80% of dates, validate on the next 10–15%, and reserve the most recent \\~10–15% as a final test set. This mimics “real” forward testing.\n",
        "* **No Lookahead:** Never use future data to compute features for earlier dates. Always compute features and labels using only past information up to time *t*.\n",
        "* **Purged K-Fold CV:** For robust evaluation, consider time-series cross-validation with “purging” as described in financial ML literature. In each fold, designate a test interval, then **purge** (remove) any training samples whose label/event window overlaps the test window. Also apply an **embargo** gap (e.g. a few days) after the test period where training is not allowed. This prevents leakage from very near future data into training. As described in \\[19], the purge-embargo procedure “purges any overlapping data points from the training set that coincide with the event windows in the test set” and then “embargoes a period after each test set”. Following these steps (purging overlaps and adding time gaps) yields a more realistic train/test separation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use time-aware splits in hyperparameter tuning as well (for example, use PurgedKFold to create folds). The steps in \\[27] outline this clearly: split the timeline into folds, designate one part as test, purge overlapping event labels from training, impose an embargo, then train on the cleaned training set.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 8. Final Notes for Accuracy and Profitability\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Feature/Threshold Tuning:** Experiment with different lookahead windows (2 vs 3 days) or thresholds (10% as given, maybe test 8–12% range) to see what maximizes profit in backtests.\n",
        "* **Model Choice:** Use models robust to noise (e.g. tree ensembles or neural nets). Consider ensembling multiple classifiers.\n",
        "* **Backtest Profit:** Beyond classification metrics, simulate a simple trading strategy: buy on predicted entry days, sell when 10% gain is hit or after a fixed holding period. Optimize model cutoff (e.g. probability threshold) for maximum net return or Sharpe ratio.\n",
        "* **Avoid Overfitting:** Keep the model and feature set as simple as necessary. Validate predictions across different market regimes (bull/bear) to ensure they generalize.\n",
        "* **Monitoring:** As new data arrives, periodically re-run the labeling and model training to adapt to regime changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "By following this pipeline – from data collection (via Bybit/Binance APIs) through careful labeling and feature design – you create a rich dataset of multi-crypto daily signals. The use of technical indicators (MA, RSI, MACD, ATR, etc.) and cross-market signals gives the model diverse predictive inputs. Threshold-based labeling (10% gain in 2–3 days) focuses on meaningful moves. Handling imbalance (e.g. via SMOTE) and proper time-series splits ensures valid training. This comprehensive dataset maximizes the chances of a model that accurately and profitably predicts entry points.\n",
